# Cross Origin HostingIf you need to host the library files on a separate origin (domain) to the page
containing the chart then please ensure that the
[`library_path` widget constructor parameter](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#library_path)
is configured as follows:

The `library_path` value should start with either `http://` or `https://`,
followed by the url to the folder containing the library's static
files.

- example: `library_path: 'https://example.com/charting_library/'`

- `library_path` should end with a trailing forward slash.

## Example: Loading the standalone version from separate origin
If you hosted the library files within a folder named `charting_library` on the
`example.com` domain then you would configure the library as follows.
### Loading the standalone script
Place the following script tag within the `<head>` of the page.

```
<script
    type="text/javascript"
    src="https://example.com/charting_library/charting_library.standalone.js"
></script>

```
### Specifying the `library_path` parameter
When evoking the widget constructor, ensure that the `library_path` value starts
with `http` as described above.
```
var widget = (window.tvWidget = new TradingView.widget({
    library_path: 'https://example.com/charting_library/',

    symbol: 'A',
    interval: '1D',
    container: 'tv_chart_container',
    datafeed: new Datafeeds.UDFCompatibleDatafeed(
        'https://demo_feed.tradingview.com'
    ),
}));

```
## Server setup
Make sure that the server hosting the library files is configured to allow
cross-origin requests from the origin of the page containing the chart element.
Please see this MDN article for more information:
[Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
### Demo Charts and Study Templates Storage Server
Please note that the
demo charts and [study template storage server](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/saving_loading/save-load-rest-api/#use-demo-storage)
(`http://saveload.tradingview.com`) isn't compatible with requests from any
origin except `localhost` and `tradingview.com`. Attempting to use this server
from any other origin will still result in a CORS error.
Please see [Saving and Loading Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/saving_loading/) for an
overview on how to setup your own storage server.
