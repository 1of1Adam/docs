# NPMYou can install the library as an NPM dependency. Follow the steps below to set it up.

## 1. Configure package.json
Specify the library version number.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "charting_library": "git@github.com:tradingview/charting_library.git#semver:28.0.0"
  }
}

```
Note that files located in `node_modules/charting_library/` are not bundled during the build process.
You need to ensure that these files are included on the server and can be accessed by a specific path.
To do this, add a script to copy the files into a folder that serves static assets. In this example, the `public` folder is used, but this may vary based on your project structure.
Adjust the `copy-files` command accordingly.
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npm run copy-files",
    "copy-files": "cp -R node_modules/charting_library/ public"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "charting_library": "git@github.com:tradingview/charting_library.git#semver:28.0.0"
  }
}

```
## 2. Run npm install
This command also triggers the `postinstall` script, which copies the static files into the specified directory.

> **Info:** The library repository is private. `npm install` will only work if the Git client is logged into an account with access to the repository.

If the `ssh -T git@github.com` command works, your SSH is set up correctly.
